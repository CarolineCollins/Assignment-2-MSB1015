Welcome to the repository of Assignment 2, where a complete beginner will employ
Github pages, Rmarkdown, SPARQL queries and multivariate statistics to do some 
Computational chemistry. Visit the page at https://carolinecollins.github.io/Assignment-2-MSB1015/Reuseable-Wiener.html

As a prerequisite, this notebook needs a certain Wikidata query R package which you can find here:

This assignment is part of weeks 4 and 5 of Scientific Programming on the Master's Systems Biology at Maastricht University.

You are welcome to reuse my code, reuseability is, after all the main focus of this assignment. 
If you have any comments I'd be happy to hear them, get in touch.
