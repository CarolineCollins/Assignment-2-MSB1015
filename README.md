Welcome to the repository of Assignment 2, where I have employed
Github pages, Rmarkdown, SPARQL queries, the WikiData and CDK databases and multivariate statistics (PLS) to do some 
Computational chemistry. 
Visit the report page at [https://carolinecollins.github.io/Assignment-2-MSB1015/Reuseable-Wiener.html] to see how I built two models, one knowledge- and one data-driven, to predict the boiling points of alkanes from descriptors of their structural chemistry.

As a prerequisite, this notebook needs a certain Wikidata query R package which you can find here:

This assignment was part of weeks 4 and 5 of Scientific Programming on the Master's Systems Biology at Maastricht University.

You are welcome to reuse my code, reuseability was, after all the main focus of this assignment. 
If you have any comments I'd be happy to hear them, just get in touch.
